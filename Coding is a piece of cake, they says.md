Hello, back with me again Hitsuko. I'll be pointing my thoughts about people in the Internet backwards and nowadays. Let's start with a little history here, wouldn't ya? 

In the old days, I've been learning jQuery and PHP, although I'd misunderstood jQuery that day. I thought jQuery was the replacement of JavaScript as JS was no longer used, as I've seen everyone uses jQuery that time---or maybe just my thoughts. So I coded things with a little misunderstood in my mind. 

Now, I've realized that jQuery was not that great. But don't hate them. They're the same with us---they code, code, and code, even if anyone else being rude to them, they just walk. Can we do this thing? Now, you can think again whether you're the one who's bullying jQuery or you're proud in jQuery, same as me. 

Nowadays, Internet has been a bad place to stay into. No more peaceful days or maybe it's just me the one who's not peaceful, everyone has a bad attitude and they're rude now. Ugh, it just hurts sometimes seeing your hard work's mocked by rude people. They just seen everything with their own view, not by people's person view.

It seems like the Internet was a real and real demon to stay into. But don't stop interneting because of this message, I'm one of the netizen and I'm proud of it. So---that's all what I want to say, and I would like to see your reaction about this repository. Maybe you might comment 'Go home, you're drunk' or anything like that, but I'll dunno. You'd agreed with this repository? Please watch this repository if you don't mind.
